### Please note: I've deprecated this repository, in favor of keeping all of my dotfiles under [n0nick/dotfiles](https://github.com/n0nick/dotfiles). This is here just for history backup.

<s>This is my personal Vim configuration, here mainly for backup and sharing.
I guarantee nothing.</s>

<s>Most of the stuff (especially `~/.vimrc` and stuff under `plugins/settings`)
are inspired by [YADR](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles).</s>

## <s>Installation</s>

1. <s>Clone the repository into `~/.vim`</s>

        git clone https://github.com/n0nick/vimrc.git ~/.vim

2. <s>Use the install script.
   This will link `~/.vimrc` and `~/.vimrc.after`,
   install [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)
   and use Vundle.vim for installing other plugins.</s>
